This is a Simple Project for Checking places to travel around many world regions based on search criteria.

## Prerequisites & Installation
1) Before starting with the project, you need to install Java on your system.
2) Use any IDE you want, I Chose Eclipse
3) While Initiating everything, make sure you have the correct driver. I Used Chrome Drive with the old version (114.0.5735.199)


## Code and Test Scripts
Now Let's Break down the Code, This solution was designed with POM as shown in the below image.
